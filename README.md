# Image-Classification-CNN

Project Description:

This project showcases the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The main objective is to accurately classify images as either cats or dogs. The code loads image data from CSV files, preprocesses it by reshaping and normalizing the pixel values, and then splits it into training and testing sets.

The CNN architecture consists of two sets of convolutional layers with max-pooling for feature extraction, followed by flattening and dense layers for classification. The model is compiled with the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. It is then trained on the training data over a defined number of epochs, with batch processing.

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the testing data, calculating both the loss and accuracy metrics. The trained model is also saved for future use. A random test image is displayed, and the model predicts whether it contains a cat or a dog. The project serves as a fundamental example of using CNNs for image classification tasks and highlights the key steps from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
